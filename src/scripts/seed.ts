/**
 * Seed script for WriteSpace.
 *
 * Safety: refuses to run if the users table already has rows.
 * Deterministic: same RNG_SEED → same data.
 *
 * Design note — denormalized counters:
 *   Post `like_count`, `view_count`, `share_count` and user
 *   `total_followers` / `total_following` are set directly to
 *   plausible high values. We insert only a small subset of real
 *   `likes` / `follows` rows so the UI behaves correctly when a
 *   visitor interacts (increment / decrement the counter by 1).
 *
 *   This keeps the dataset inside Neon's 0.5 GB free-tier limit
 *   while still showing a "busy" platform in the UI.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run db:seed
 *   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npm run db:seed

There is no arrangement where you get everything for free, and pretending otherwise just defers the cost to a time when it's harder to pay.",

  "There's a class of bugs that only appears under load, and they're the most expensive kind. Your code is technically correct. Your tests pass. But the interaction between two components at concurrency ten thousand produces a failure mode that no amount of local reasoning predicts.",

Half the bugs I've fixed came from explaining the code well enough to notice it was wrong.",
